🐠 Underwater Finger Counting Quiz App
An interactive, educational app designed for young children to learn numbers and answer questions using hand gestures! Built with PyQt5 for a fun GUI and integrated with a TensorFlow-based finger-counting model using OpenCV and cvzone for real-time interaction.

📌 Features
🎨 Fun underwater-themed GUI
✋ Real-time finger counting using webcam
🤖 TensorFlow model trained to recognize 1-10 finger gestures
❓ Question-answer stages for number recognition and counting
👶 Designed for early learners with engaging visuals and feedback

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
PyQt5
OpenCV
TensorFlow
cvzone (for hand tracking)
MediaPipe (optional for hand detection)
NumPy

🧠 How It Works
The app displays a question (e.g., “Show 4 fingers”).
The child shows the correct number of fingers in front of the webcam.
The finger-counting model predicts the number.
The app gives feedback and moves to the next stage if correct.

📚 Future Improvements
Support for multiple languages
Add more quiz categories (crosswords, patterns etc.)
Deploy as a desktop/mobile app
